There are 5 prisoners in solitary cells. There’s a central
living room with one light bulb; this bulb is initially off. No
prisoner can see the light bulb from his or her own cell.
Every day, the warden picks a prisoner equally at random,
and that prisoner visits the living room. While there, the
prisoner can toggle the bulb if he or she wishes. Also, the
prisoner has the option of asserting that all 5 prisoners
have been to the living room by now. If this assertion is
false, all 5 prisoners are shot. If it is true, however, all
prisoners are set free. Thus, the assertion should only be
made if the prisoner is certain of its validity. The prisoners
are allowed to get together on the first night to discuss a
plan. Once they’ve agreed on a plan, the game starts and
they can’t meet again.
